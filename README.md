## Dream, Build, Inspire with PlebLab
At PlebLab, we are dedicated to supporting the next generation of Bitcoin builders and startups as a hackerspace and community accelerator in Austin, Texas. PlebLab's mission is to foster a community of developers, hackers, creatives, and builders of open-source software/hardware. We create a space where individuals can collaborate, elevate their skills, and transform seemingly impossible ideas into reality.

PlebBook is a community resource for aspiring developers and builders to learn and get involved with the Bitcoin Lightning ecosystem. Kinda like a builders manual for Bitcoin and Lightning.

PlebLab at its core is a group of misfit hackers who firmly believe that coming together to support developers is key for bitcoin to continue. Free and open-source development is critical to breakthroughs in bitcoin. The FOSS ethos is at the center of what we do here at PlebLab.
