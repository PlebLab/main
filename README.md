## Dream • Build • Inspire
At **PlebLab**, we’re empowering the next generation of Bitcoin builders from our hackerspace and community accelerator in Austin, Texas. It represents the belief that anyone can become a builder in the Bitcoin space—regardless of background, pedigree, or location. You don't need permission, just curiosity and tenacity. It’s DIY, sovereign, and collaborative. We cultivate a strong community of developers, hackers, creatives, and founders shipping open-source projects, startups, software, hardware, and code.

PlebLab sprouted from the [**Austin Bitcoin Club**](https://youtu.be/FcaQ-EifEJY?si=wfNThDlGVw1PAqEB) and now fuels a monthly meetup with [@BTCBuildersClub](https://x.com/BTCBuildersClub), hosted at Capital Factory.

Since summer 2025, we’ve been creating a recurring event that fits Austin’s vibrant tech community—bridging Bitcoin and builder culture where people gather day and night, online and IRL, for meetups, classes, and co-working.
